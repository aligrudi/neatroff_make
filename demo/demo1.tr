.\" Neatroff Tutorial #1
.\"
.\" The demo subdirectory of neatroff_make contains a few examples of
.\" using Neatroff; they help particularly those users who have good
.\" experience in using Troff.  What follows demonstrates the basics of
.\" using Neatroff, assuming that the reader has never used Troff before.
.\" Nevertheless, this section would probably help any new user of
.\" Neatroff.
.\"
.\" ===================
.\" SETTING UP NEATROFF
.\" ===================
.\"
.\" You can set up Neatroff as follows.
.\"
.\" $ git clone git://github.com/aligrudi/neatroff_make.git
.\" $ cd neatroff_make
.\" $ make init		# Downloads the required programs and some fonts
.\" $ make neat		# Compiles the programs
.\"
.\" For rendering this file, you can perform the following steps.
.\"
.\" + Create a directory to store your Neatroff documents.
.\" + Copy the Makefile in neatroff_make/demo to this directory.
.\" + Edit the value of BASE in the Makefile to point to neatroff_make.
.\" + Edit the line beginning with "all:"; remove the names of files
.\"   that appear after it in this line.
.\" + Create a file name demo1.tr with the contents of this file.
.\" + Add demo1.pdf after "all:" in the Makefile.

.\" TROFF BASICS
.\" ============
.\"
.\" As you have already guessed, lines starting with .\" are comments.
Hello Neatroff.
.\" Blank lines cause a line break and some vertical spacing (unless
.\" using blm request).

Basic requests:
.\" The br request causes a line break as well.
.br
.\" Requests can start with a dot or quote in a separate line, or
.\" combined with the text after a backslash.
Words \s[16]can\s0 be \s+[5]Larger\s0 or \s-[5]Smaller\s0.
.\" You can also insert vertical space using sp request.
.sp 3
.\" You can also use ps request to change font size, and vs to change
.\" the vertical space between lines.
.ps 14
.vs 14
.\" Defaults fonts: R (roman), B (bold), I (italic); P is the previous
.\" font.
Fonts can be \fBchanged\fP.
.\" You can also use fp request.
.fp I
This is \m[cyan]cyan\m[]; \m[#382]colour\m[] does help
.\" The colour can be also changed using cl request
.cl #244
sometimes.
.cl
.sp

.\" DEFINING MACROS
.\" ===============
.\"
.\" A multi-line macro can be defined as follows; the definition ends
.\" at a line containing "..".
.de mac1
.	ft B
.	cl #824
\\$1
.	ft P
.	cl
..
.\" This is a single-line macro.
.ds mac2 "\m[\\$2]\\$1\m[] (\\$2)
.\" They can be invoked as follows (\\$N is replaced by argument N).
.mac1 Macros
in \*[mac2 colour red].
.sp
.\" Numbers and strings can be saved in registers.
.nr count 20
.ds name "Page
There are \n[count] of \*[name]s.
